QUICK START

When fetching sources directly from the source code repository,
use the following command to get the necessary dependencies, etc.,
for a working configure script.

    ./bootstrap --skip-po

After that, you can use the normal build steps documented in INSTALL.

IN DEPTH

The bootstrap script is from gnulib. It will download the latest
version of gnulib, run gnulib-tool, autoconf, and friends. For
more information, run

    ./bootstrap --help
