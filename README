Apple ][ Disk Tools [DEPRECATED]



This entire library is now DEPRECATED:

a2catalog was used in building https://github.com/cmosher01/Apple-II-Source
but that need has been eliminated.

a2nibblize was used to convert DSK images to NIB format for the
Epple ][ emulator https://github.com/cmosher01/Epple-II but the emulator
now uses WOZ 2 format images exclusively.

to_woz2 and empty_woz (for creating WOZ 2 images) have been moved to
https://github.com/cmosher01/DskToWoz2





The following is from the original README:





This contains some small programs for dealing with a subset of
functions concerning Apple ][ floppy disk images.



to_woz2 converts .dsk and .d13 disk image files to WOZ 2.0 format files.

empty_woz creates empty WOZ 2.0 files (no tracks).

a2catalog program is for generating the "VTOC" and catalog track (usually
$11) for Apple ][ floppy disk images.

a2nibblize program is for creating "nibble" format Apple ][
floppy disk images.
